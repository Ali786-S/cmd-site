CMD Website  
The Crisis of Migration Discourse

This repository contains the source code for the public-facing website of The Crisis of Migration Discourse (CMD) project. The site has been designed as a central digital space to present the project’s aims, research activities, collaborators, and public-facing outputs in a clear and accessible format.

The website is built as a lightweight, static site to ensure long-term stability, ease of maintenance, and straightforward deployment across different hosting environments.

Project Background

The Crisis of Migration Discourse is an interdisciplinary research project that examines how migration is framed, debated, and politicised across media, policy, and public discourse. The project adopts a critical and participatory perspective, aiming to challenge dominant crisis narratives and contribute to the development of a more inclusive and socially grounded lexicon of migration.

This website functions both as a public information hub for non-academic audiences and as a reference point for researchers, collaborators, and stakeholders involved in the project.

Website Structure

The site consists of multiple static pages, including a homepage introducing the project and its core themes, pages outlining research objectives, work packages and methodology, information about project partners and collaborators, and a contact page for enquiries and engagement.

All assets are organised clearly using a conventional front-end structure for readability and maintainability.

Technologies Used

HTML5 is used for semantic page structure and content. CSS provides custom styling, layout, and responsive design. JavaScript is used selectively for client-side interactivity where required.

No external frameworks are used, ensuring transparency in the codebase and ease of future extension.

Deployment

The site is hosted using a hosting platform where the domain was also bought from 

Deployment is handled directly from the main branch, allowing updates to be published with minimal overhead.

Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the authoritative source for the CMD website code, as a record of ongoing development and iteration, and as a reference point for collaborators who may contribute to content or structure in future phases of the project.

Maintenance and Future Development

The site is intentionally modular to support future content expansion, additional media integration, and ongoing accessibility and usability improvements. Updates and revisions will be reflected through standard version control practices.
