    <h1 class="page-title">Work Package 3:RECONSTRUCTION OF ALTERNATIVE <i>JUST</i> MIGRATION DISCOURSE (Months 27-32) </h1>

    <p class="lead">Led by: Alicia Ferrández and with support from MV, ITASTRA and COSPE</p>

    <p>
      WP3 is aimed at designing a pilot test case for implementing the Toolkit for Action in institutional contexts. For this reason, we will focus on all countries participating in the consortium (the UK, France, Spain, Denmark and Italy).
    </p>

    <ol class="styled-list">
      <li>
        The Toolkit will form the basis of three one-day intercultural competence workshops (Barrett et. al. 2013; Hurn & Tomalin, 2013; Arasaratnam, 2016; Matveev, 2017) that will be carried out with stakeholders in the above-specified countries. Each workshop will be attended by 8 participants, and the researchers.
      </li>

      <li>
        The workshops will engage different stakeholders, namely, journalists x8 (workshop 1), local, regional, and national policymakers x8 (workshop 2), and secondary school educators x8 (workshop 3).
      </li>

      <li>
        Workshops will be organised in collaboration with our associate partners (Migrant Voice, ITASTRA and COSPE). The workshops will use the ‘Toolkit for Action’ as a resource for discussions. They will aim to complicate hegemonic narratives by revealing and legitimising alternative understandings <b>(Months 27-29)</b>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The workshops in the UK will be organised with the help of Migrant Voice. Prior to the workshop with policy makers, the UK team will publish an article on the research aims and objectives on the ‘House Magazine’, the parliament published magazine read by MPs for the purpose of reaching national level policy making representatives (cost in the UK budget). The UK team will also contact members of parliamentary committees that work on migration and MP and Lords’ parliamentary assistants. They will all be briefed on
 
the research. In France the WP3 workshops will be run by Desinfox Migrations. In Italy they will be run with the help of ITASTRA while in Spain and Denmark, they will be organised with the help of COSPE. All WP3 workshops will be recorded and transcribed. They will enable us to compare between different stakeholders’ narratives on migration and deservingness and will provide a comparison between them, and the illegalised migrants' discourses (WP2). This will shed light to convergences and divergences in narratives and will facilitate the building of awareness and intercultural competences.

      Test more appropriate integration and empowerment strategies by relevant authorities across contexts.
