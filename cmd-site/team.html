      The CMD project is shaped by the knowledge and expertise of leading academic institutions across Europe. 
      These universities and research centres bring together specialists in media, language, migration and social justice. 
      Working side by side with CMD’s NGOs and non-academic partners, they carry out research, share insights, train participants and help develop new ways of thinking and talking about migration. 
      Their work gives the project a strong foundation and connects it to wider networks of scholarship and policy.

          Prof. Roza Tsagarousianou is Professor of Media and Migration at the School of Media and Communications, University of Westminster, and serves as the Project Lead for the HERA/CHANSE-funded project ‘The Crisis of Migration Discourse: A Participatory Approach for a New Lexicon of Migration’.
          </p>
        </p>
          She is also the Co-Lead of the University of Westminster’s Diversity and Inclusion Research Community (DIC). In her role as Research Co-Lead for DIC, Prof. Tsagarousianou develops and shapes research policy in the area of Diversity and Inclusion across the University’s Colleges and Schools. She is a member of the CAMRI and Homelands research centres, as well as the Westminster University Migration Network. She has previously served for several years as Director of the CAMRI Doctoral Programme, a role in which she contributed significantly to its development and expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
Her research interests centre on population movements, technologies of control at Europe’s borders, and the possibilities of resistance to these mechanisms. Drawing on racial capitalism, decolonial scholarship, and conceptual history, Prof. Tsagarousianou investigates differing understandings of human rights at the borders of the European Union and explores time as a foundational technology in the governance of migration. She is currently working on her forthcoming book, ‘The Time of the Other: Migration, Borders and the Politics of Time’, to be published by Palgrave MacMillan in 2026. The book examines how dominant temporal regimes—rooted in Western capitalist modernity—racialize, discipline and differentiate lives positioned outside the temporal order of ‘modern’ nations. It further seeks to uncover forms of resistance to these technologies of control by illuminating the narratives and practices of those who are marginalised and subjugated, thereby challenging hegemonic temporal narratives and revealing possibilities for more just and inclusive temporalities.

        <p class="partner-bio">
          Dr Federica Mazzara is a Reader in Cultural Studies in the School of Humanities at the University of Westminster. Her research focuses on migration, crisis communication, visual culture, art, and transnational activism. She is particularly interested in how human movement is represented in mainstream discourse and how counternarratives challenge that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Federica is the author of several articles and of Reframing Migration: Lampedusa, Border Spectacle and Aesthetics of Subversion (Peter Lang, 2019), which examines how artistic interventions can disrupt media and political representations of migration in the Mediterranean. She is currently developing a new monograph, Mocking the Borders: Art, Humour, and Resistance in a Divided World, which investigates how humour and play operate as tools of critique and re-signification in border-related art.
        </p>
        <p>
            She leads the British Academy–funded project Migrants in Transit: A Transdisciplinary Writing Programme for Emerging Scholars of Migration in Tunisia (2023–2025), and serves as Co-Investigator on the €1.3 million HERA/CHANSE-funded project CMD: The Crisis of Migration Discourse – A Participatory Approach for a New Lexicon of Migration. From 2019 to 2023, she was Scientific Coordinator of the Erasmus+ project MIGRANT – Master Degree in Migration Studies: Governance, Policies and Cultures in Tunisia.
Federica is also involved in art curation. In 2019, she co-curated the exhibition Sink Without Trace at the P21 Gallery in London, which addressed the issue of migrant deaths at sea. She is Review Editor for Crossings: Journal of Migration and Culture (Intellect) and an active contributor to debates on migration, art, and communication.

          Dr Anne Vestergaard is an Associate Professor of Organisational Communication and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at Copenhagen Business School. Her research focuses on communication for social change, pursued through two main strands: CSR communication and humanitarian communication. She examines how the increasing overlap between commercial and non-commercial sectors affects the identity, image, and social impact of civil society organisations, as well as how moral and economic forces shape discourses within and around corporations. Her broader academic interest lies in understanding how institutional, technological, and semiotic processes influence mainstream moral discourses in contemporary society.

            Dr Haleemah Alaydi is a Research Fellow on the Crisis of Migration Discourse: Towards a Participatory New Lexicon of Migration at the School of Media and Communication, University of Westminster. 
Her work examines how migration narratives, policy and public discourses construct migration through the lens of crisis, particularly in relation to people who use unauthorised routes to enter the EU and the UK. She collaborates with illegalised migrants as agents of change to co-create counter-narratives.
Haleemah holds a PhD in English with Creative Writing from the University of York, where her practice-based research explored arts-based methods in migration research and the temporal dimensions of migration journeys from the Arab world. Her doctoral studies were fully funded by the Acton-Goodman Scholarship and the Department of English and Related Literature at the University of York. She also holds a master’s degree in Writing for Performance and Publication (Distinction) from the University of Leeds, which was fully funded by a Chevening Scholarship.

            Drawing on 5 years of fieldwork with forced migrants, Haleemah has presented ethnographic findings on the impact of the criminalisation and border externalisation on forced migrants across the UK-France border. Her research focuses on racial justice, forced migration, refugee education, Channel crossings and the asylum system. Specifically, she is interested in the role of trauma-informed participatory approaches in the representations of refugee subjectivities.
Haleemah has also worked as a policy and research consultant for several non-governmental organisations across the UK and Jordan. Her recent work on the experiences of forced migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats is published in the Channel Crossings research report (October 2025). She also published an article on involving refugees as peer researchers as part of her work on the Experiences of Displaced Young People Living in England: January to March 2023 project
